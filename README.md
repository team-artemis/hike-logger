# Trailers

Trailers is a web application that let's you log the trails you've hiked, add pictures, and share with friends. It's a final project for Dev Bootcamp that was completing over the course of seven days by a team of five people. Come explore our repo and feel free to contribute, comment or give feedback. 

Our team is:
- Daniela Schiano di Cola
- Travis Siebenhaar
- Derek Gerson
- Ehtesham Khan
- Andrew Patterson

We worked with Ruby on Rails, Mapbox, Leaflet, Semantic UI, Jquery/AJAX, and Swifticons to build the product.
